## 🏗️ Context: The Indian B2B Market

India’s B2B market thrives on long-standing relationships and negotiation-driven workflows. Flexibility in payment terms, delivery timelines, and order volumes is critical. But smaller MSMEs without strong informal networks find that most online platforms—IndiaMART, JustDial, TradeIndia, Moglix, Infra.Market—fall short in delivering the trust, fluidity, and efficiency they need.

## ⚙️ Problems with Existing Platforms

### 🗂️ Classifieds-Based Marketplaces

#### **IndiaMART**
- **Issues**: Outdated interface, inaccurate listings, inactive sellers, weak chat UX. Conversations often move to WhatsApp. Vendors face spam or junk leads.  
- **Pricing**: Freemium. Paid tiers (₹3,000–₹50,000+/yr) offer lead access, CRM, and visibility. Leads cost ~₹350+.  
- **Fit**: Doesn’t support India’s flexible B2B culture. Rigid, static, and inefficient.

#### **JustDial**
- **Issues**: Too B2C-focused. Vendors get irrelevant consumer leads. Expensive entry costs for small businesses.  
- **Pricing**: Free listings with low visibility. Paid plans: Basic (₹20,000+ setup), Premium (₹65,000–₹120,000).  
- **Fit**: Generic and rigid. Doesn’t enable negotiation or volume-based flexibility.

#### **TradeIndia**
- **Issues**: Clunky UX, limited user base, low-quality leads. Real-time negotiation is missing.  
- **Pricing**: ₹5,000–₹40,000+/yr. Leads cost ₹300–₹500.  
- **Fit**: Better pricing, but still misses the cultural expectations of dynamic deal-making.

### 🔄 Transaction-Based Marketplaces

#### **Moglix**
- **Issues**: High reliability but cost-sharing inflates prices and cuts vendor margins. Enterprise-focused UX. Complex onboarding.  
- **Pricing**: Commission-based (5–15%), with optional SaaS tools.  
- **Fit**: Rigid, opaque, and not MSME-friendly.

#### **Infra.Market**
- **Issues**: Trustworthy supply but private-label model erodes vendor flexibility. Limited differentiation. Complex onboarding.  
- **Pricing**: 5–15% commission with bundled services.  
- **Fit**: Misaligned with India's flexible, trust-based B2B practices.

## 🚀 Proposing STHI (SiteSathi)

The initial website was designed to onboard early vendors and buyers. The approach:

> Cold-call local businesses → If interested, ask them to search their Google Place on our website → Log in via GMB → Auto-schedule a GMeet → Verify the business + pitch the platform.

## 📱 What STHI Could Be

A mobile-first app for construction-centered B2B procurement. Here’s how it works:

- **Demand-Driven Orderbooks**  
  Verified vendors and buyers interact over structured, algorithm-recommended requirements.

- **Gamified Vendor UI**  
  A Tinder-style swipe experience lets vendors respond to relevant orders. Matches trigger a negotiation flow that generates a structured quote and semi-automated purchase order.

- **No Contact-Sharing**  
  Replaces WhatsApp/phone call workflows with in-app structured negotiation.

- **Credibility Scoring**  
  Combines Google ratings with in-app metrics to personalize recommendations and auto-filter inactive vendors.

- **Pay-As-You-Go**  
  A credit-based revenue model replaces long-term subscriptions. Users pay only for what they use.
