India’s B2B market runs on long-standing relationships and negotiation-driven workflows. Flexibility in payment terms, delivery timelines, and order volumes is critical. But for smaller MSMEs lacking access to these informal networks, most online platforms—IndiaMART, JustDial, TradeIndia, Moglix, Infra.Market—fail to replicate the trust, fluidity, and efficiency they need.

Note: This isn’t an MVP or functional prototype—just a proof of thought and initial direction.

The Problem with Existing Platforms
Classifieds-Based Marketplaces
IndiaMART
Issues: Buyers face a clunky interface, outdated listings, and inactive sellers. Weak chat UX pushes conversations to WhatsApp. Verification is lax, so buyers must manually filter junk. Vendors get spammy or low-intent leads.
Pricing: Freemium model with paid subscriptions (₹3,000–₹50,000+/yr) offering visibility, CRM, and lead access (~₹350+ per lead).
Seller ROI: Affordable, but low-quality leads and high competition hurt returns.
Cultural Fit: Poor. Lacks built-in negotiation flow and flexibility.

JustDial
Issues: More B2C than B2B. Shallow product catalogs and irrelevant consumer leads waste vendor time. High entry pricing gates out small businesses.
Pricing: Free basic listings. Paid plans start at ₹20,000+setup, going up to ₹1.2L for premium.
Seller ROI: Not viable for MSMEs.
Cultural Fit: Largely rigid and too generic for B2B workflows.

TradeIndia
Issues: Clunky UX and limited listings. Smaller user base = fewer matches. Real-time negotiation isn’t built-in.
Pricing: ₹5,000–₹40,000+/yr for features like RFQ access and site creation. Leads cost ~₹300–₹500.
Seller ROI: Moderate costs, but weak conversions.
Cultural Fit: Still rigid. Doesn't reflect dynamic B2B culture.

Transaction-Based Marketplaces
Moglix
Issues: Great on reliability and quality control, but cost-sharing drives up buyer prices and slashes vendor margins. Enterprise-focused UX alienates MSMEs.
Pricing: Commission (5–15%) per sale. SaaS tools are extra.
Seller ROI: High barrier to entry and poor margins for smaller players.
Cultural Fit: Opaque, standardized pricing ≠ India’s deal-making culture.

Infra.Market
Issues: High trust and logistics, but private-label model reduces vendor differentiation. Complex onboarding and fixed pricing limit adoption.
Pricing: 5–15% commission with bundled services.
Seller ROI: Low, unless you’re enterprise-sized.
Cultural Fit: Not aligned. No space for flexibility or haggling.

Proposing STHI (SiteSathi)
The website was designed for onboarding early vendors and buyers. The idea: cold-call local businesses, and if they’re interested, ask them to find their business on Google Places via the site, log in with their GMB account, and auto-schedule a Google Meet where we verify them as a legitimate business and pitch our idea at the same time.

A mobile-first app built for India’s construction-centered B2B ecosystem, STHI runs on demand-driven order books with verified users on both ends (vendors and buyers) and quality control to help commoditize less brand-sensitive inputs like cement, steel, and bricks. It partners with last-mile logistics to capitalize on the strengths of India’s fragmented vendor base and speed up hyperlocal procurement.

Vendors interact with a gamified, Tinder-style UI to swipe on buyer-posted requirements recommended by our algorithm. This kicks off a lightweight negotiation flow that ends in a structured quote object and a semi-automated purchase order. No chaotic WhatsApp chats or cold calling.

Credibility scores are dynamic — combining Google reviews and in-app performance — and directly influence algorithmic recommendations. Inactive sellers are quietly phased out through negative filtering.

Our revenue model is usage-based. A credit system allows businesses to pay only for what they use, instead of getting locked into long-term subscriptions that often underdeliver.
