India’s B2B market thrives on long-standing relationships and a negotiation-driven culture, where flexibility in payment terms, delivery conditions, and order volumes is key. For less-established MSMEs lacking access to widespread informal networks, existing online platforms like IndiaMART, JustDial, TradeIndia, Moglix, and Infra.Market fall short in replicating the trust, flexibility, and efficiency these businesses need.

### The Problem with Existing Platforms

#### Classifieds-Based Marketplaces

- **IndiaMART**
    - **Challenges**: Buyers face an outdated, high-friction interface with inaccurate listings, inactive sellers, and weak chat functionality, pushing them to WhatsApp. Subpar verification standards require manual filtering, while vendors deal with low-quality or fraudulent leads. The rigid structure clashes with India’s dynamic B2B culture.
    - **Pricing & Revenue Model**: Freemium model with free listings. Paid subscriptions (Silver, Gold, Platinum, ₹3,000–₹50,000+/year) offer priority listing, BuyLeads access, CRM tools, and payment facilitation. Leads cost ~₹350+ each. Piloting transaction fees.
    - **Seller Impact**: Affordable for MSMEs, but low-quality leads and high competition reduce ROI for smaller vendors.
    - **Cultural Alignment**: Lacks negotiation tools, misaligning with flexible B2B norms.
- **JustDial**
    - **Challenges**: Primarily B2C, JustDial lacks B2B product depth and industry-specific filters, making procurement inefficient. Vendors get irrelevant leads from its consumer base, and high pricing excludes smaller businesses. The generic model limits customized terms.
    - **Pricing & Revenue Model**: Free listings with low visibility. Paid plans: Basic (₹20,000 setup + ₹2,000/month) or Premium (₹65,000–₹120,000 one-time) for priority listing, lead access, and promotion. JD Mart charges for leads.
    - **Seller Impact**: High costs deter MSMEs; B2C focus yields irrelevant leads, lowering ROI.
    - **Cultural Alignment**: Rigid model doesn’t support negotiation, misaligning with B2B needs.
- **TradeIndia**
    - **Challenges**: Inconsistent listing accuracy and a less intuitive interface hinder buyers. A smaller user base limits supplier options. Vendors face low lead volumes and unverified inquiries, reducing conversions. Industry focus doesn’t support real-time negotiation.
    - **Pricing & Revenue Model**: Free listings. Paid subscriptions (₹5,000–₹40,000+/year) include priority listing, Trust Stamp, RFQ access, and website creation. Leads cost ~₹300–₹500.
    - **Seller Impact**: Moderate costs, but low lead volumes and inconsistent listings reduce ROI.
    - **Cultural Alignment**: Limited flexibility despite industry focus, falling short of dynamic B2B needs.

#### Transaction-Based Marketplaces

- **Moglix**
    - **Challenges**: Ensures reliability, timely deliveries, and quality control with flexible financing, but cost-sharing raises buyer prices and cuts vendor margins, deterring SMEs. Standardized processes feel rigid, and smaller networks limit diversity. Complex onboarding and enterprise focus alienate smaller businesses.
    - **Pricing & Revenue Model**: Commission (5–15% per sale) covers logistics, quality control, and lead matching. Sellers share operational costs. SaaS tools (e.g., vendor management) have subscription fees. No listing fees, but strict onboarding.
    - **Seller Impact**: High commissions and costs deter MSMEs; enterprise focus excludes smaller vendors.
    - **Cultural Alignment**: Opaque, rigid pricing clashes with negotiation-driven culture.
- **Infra.Market**
    - **Challenges**: Offers reliable supply and quality control, but cost-sharing and private-label model increase prices and reduce margins. Standardized processes, complex onboarding, and large-enterprise focus limit SME access. Opaque pricing erodes trust.
    - **Pricing & Revenue Model**: Commission-based (5–15% per sale) with cost-sharing for logistics and quality control. Private-label model may involve fixed pricing contracts. No listing fees, but complex onboarding.
    - **Seller Impact**: High costs and low margins deter MSMEs; enterprise focus limits access.
    - **Cultural Alignment**: Opaque, standardized pricing hinders negotiation, misaligning with B2B norms.


### Proposing STHI (SiteSathi)

A mobile-first app serving as a construction-centered B2B marketplace, STHI runs on demand-driven orderbooks combined with user verification (for both vendors and buyers, since it’s B2B-only), and quality-control measures to help commoditize less brand-sensitive materials like cement, steel, and bricks. It’s partnered with last-mile logistics to leverage the strengths of India’s fragmented B2B vendor market and speed up proximity-based procurement.

A Tinder-style, gamified UI lets vendors swipe on requirements recommended by the algorithm — posted by buyers — kicking off a streamlined negotiation process to finalize a quote object and semi-automatically generate purchase orders. This replaces the typical freeform chat or phone-call model.

Credibility scores are calculated using a mix of external ratings (e.g., Google) and in-app performance metrics, which also influence recommendations. Market pressure is flipped — inactive sellers get filtered out automatically.

The revenue model runs on a credit-based system to reduce user commitment. Users pay only for what they use, avoiding long-term contracts that often don’t deliver enough ROI.
